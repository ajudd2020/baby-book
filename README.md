# Baby Book

Thank you for checking out my react-native firebase application. I built this application using:

- React-Native
- Expo
- Firebase firestore
- Firebase storage

Of course, the main language used is JavaScript.

## Why Baby Book?

When we were challenged to come up with an app that we would actually use, I instantly thought of this idea. We had three days to investigate a new technology and implement it into something we were interested in.

Being a mom is the most amazing that I have ever done. And coding is the second. So, when I got the chance to do whatever I wanted, I decided to combine the two.

True story: I have over 20,000 pictures on my phone. And (not exaggerating) about 15,000 of them are of my daughter. She's only two, by the way... Anyways, I realized one day that I don't have a "baby book" for her. Yes, I could scroll through those 20K + pictures and find some way to store them in a seperate "album" to print them off (one day) and then buy an album and then... ugh... I'm tired just typing it all out! What I need is an app that makes a babybook for me. A place where I can instantly store the pictures I love with a quick little caption. Something I can look back on and remember the important moments of her life. Not the 15 pictures I took of her walking down the sidewalk that one really sunny day. Or, the hundreds of pictures I have of her eating yogurt because it's hilarious. I need somewhere to keep the _special_ ones. The BabyBook worthy moments.

## So... what does it actually do?! Aka. Why am I so proud of this app?

For starters, I am very proud of this app because I built it in a matter of days using technology that is _bascially_ new to me. Developing for mobile devices is very different, and using a cloud-based storage system and a non-relational database was _very_ weird (I never thought I'd say this, but I actually kind of miss SQL!). Yes, there is still a lot that I need to add. But, for now, I'm proud of my little mobile app. I'm not sure if it will ever see deployment... But, it will always have a very special place in my heart.

With that being said, let me tell you what it actually does!
